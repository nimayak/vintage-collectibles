    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    
    <p>We found these Adventure Time playing cards in an op-shop down-town one lazy sunday afternoon, and the bright colours and interesting artwork caught our eyes. 
The collection features 8 playing cards with 6 different roles which includes; lady, companion, princess, wizard, 2 heros and 2 gossips. 
We liked these cards because we are fans of the TV show ‘Adventure Time’ and thought these cards would be prized possessions to any true fan.
